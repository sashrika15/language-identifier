# language-identifier

This project will involve using the Language Detection dataset for training your machine learning/deep learning algorithm. 

### Dataset
We have used the language detection dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basilb2s/language-detection).

### Model
Multinomial Naive Bayes has been used as our model, trained on the above mentioned dataset. The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features.

### Usage and Results
To run the model, follow these steps: 

- Open your terminal and clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/sashrika15/language-identifier.git

- Change to model directory

        cd language-identifier

- Run streamlit interface

        streamlit run main.py
